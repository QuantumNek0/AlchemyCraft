# Alchemy Craft
Alchemy Add-On for Minecraft Bedrock Edition.
[YouTube Showcase](https://youtu.be/gjXjxA6IJQM)

## New Potions
Expanded Minecraft's alchemy system by adding new potions with existing vanilla effects.

New potions are now stronger and last longer.

## New Crops
Added new crops that can be harvested to obtain alchemy ingredients.

These new flowers can yield existing alchemy ingredients and new vanilla items used in new recipes.

## Late game alchemy
The philosopher stone allows the user to transmute materials into other more valuable ones, and also to brew the mythical *Elixir of Life*.

## Seamless vanilla integration
Alchemy Craft uses existing entities, items, blocks and natural game progression to incorporate the new features.
